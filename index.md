### CPSC 120 

* Lab 1 

    This was a very cute and simple lab. I loved how it was our intro to so much more and it was a gateway of knowledge.And my partner was super helpful and patient despite my laptop not working so well. I'm very glad to have a nice and smooth intro. 

* Lab 3 

    This is the first I got to work with my good friend on a lab we had such an amazing time together. And that lab was pretty interesting since we started playing around with dtaes and times. And we also had to calculate a man and a woman's BMR so that was cool and pretty straightforward. It was a definitely a good time. 

* Lab 5 

    This one was also pretty cool since we had to convert inches into feet and saw with a few other other measurements. It reminded me of cooking and how you have to switch which units of measurements you are using sometimes. My partner was very chill and patient and it was a little tough but we managed and pushed through. We both had a good time learning about that.
